                <p style="margin-top:50px;">He will also meet his favorite whale girl, tell her a joke, accompany her, kneel beside her, and drive the fish to her, watching her play with other whales. However, I have said that I have liked you thousands of times and I have never heard of it. Loneliness is probably like this. I am in front of you, but we are not at a frequency.</p>
                <h4 style="margin-top:50px;">His life is so dark, is the sun shining into the deep sea?</h4>
                <P style="margin-top:50px;">Perhaps there is a shadow in the place where the sun is shining. Even if the sun shines deep inside, the other side of the heart is still like a deep sea, without a trace of light. He is the sun himself, he must learn to lie to himself, only he can shine his heart brightly.</P>
                <p style="margin-top:50px;">In fact, he never gave up the whale song that never responded, from a sea to another sea, and looked forward to another 52Hz greeting in another small corner of the world.</p>

Whenever the stars come, Mr. Whale likes to jump out of the water and wait quietly for her appearance. Looked at her a few times, looking at it secretly, looking far away. He sometimes feels pitiful. He couldn't help but sing a whale song when he was sad.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:50px;">But Mr. Whale is not a fish. He breathes with his lungs. So this game is not for him to be more than speed, but to test patience. The lonely whale likes to spend more time on the water, this game is a big challenge. But no matter what, Mr. Whale will go all out.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:50px;">Mr. Whale also saw thousands of squid training for the victory of the competition. They regarded the game as an opportunity to change their destiny. For this reason, they could be desperate. They pulled the banner, shouted slogans, raised their fists, and sweared.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:50px;">"Ha ha ha, the squid jumps to the dragon gate, the big stinky fish also has to jump to the dragon gate, the big joke."</p>
            <p style="margin-top:50px;"> Mr. Whale was watching the time fluttering in ridicule. He broke free from the shackles. When the game came to an end, he also approached the gantry at the end. Time has already exceeded his physiological limit of 45 minutes, he used the last breath to jump over the Dragon Gate, becoming the last "fish" to get the chance.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:50px;">The squid jumped over the gantry and turned into a star. What is the whale jumping over the gantry?</p>
            <p style="margin-top:50px;">Still a whale.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:200px;">There is no extra farewell, there is nothing to say goodbye to this underwater world. He looked up at the star girl who was drifting away from himself. Without looking back, I firmly walked towards the starry sky I had looked up countless times and went to my own star girl.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:50px;">"The world is very big, life is very big, we have a chance, we must see you again."</p>
            <p style="margin-top:50px;">He was shocked by the spectacular scene he had never seen before, and he was completely unaware that he was repeating the words of the star girl.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:50px;">I want to go shopping with you, even though the depths of the universe are still dark, even though the road ahead is still lonely and lonely, I know that there is light in your place.</p>

                <p>The 52-hertz whale is an individual whale of unidentified species, which calls at the very unusual frequency of 52 Hz. This pitch is a much higher frequency than that of the other whale species with migration patterns most closely resembling this whale's[1] – the blue whale (10–39 Hz)[2] or fin whale (20 Hz).[1] It has been detected regularly in many locations since the late 1980s and appears to be the only individual emitting a whale call at this frequency. It has been described as the "world's loneliest whale".[3]</p>
